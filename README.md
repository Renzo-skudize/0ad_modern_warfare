A 0AD Mod for modern warfare since 1990.

##  What's new?

  - no cavalry
  - new units like tanks, planes, helicopters, submarines and drones
  - new structures like bunkers, aerial arsenals and launch pads for intercontinental ballic missiles
  - new AI setup
  - new quotes
## Tipps:

  - You should have some Fighters to patrol at your critical infrastructure for preventing bombers destroying it.
  - Some factions have Gen6 fighters. These in combat group with drones are able to attack targets behind the enemies' lines, even if the enemy has taken strong anti-aircraft measures (usefull if there's a sea between you and the enemy).
  - A few factions have access to launch pads for intercontinental ballistic missiles. You can activate or deactivate them. If you or one of your allies attack an enemy, you should deactivate the launch pads; else, there's the risk of friendly fire.
  - There are SSBNs, "ships submersible ballistic nuclear", that can launch SLBM-rockets, equipped with nuclear warheads, so, even if your homeland is wiped out, you can heavily damage your enemies' infrastructure and help your allies conquering them
