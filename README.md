# 0AD Modern Warfare

A 0AD Mod for modern warfare since 1990.

##  What's new?

  - no units for melee fight anymore
  - no cavalry
  - new units like tanks, planes, helicopters, submarines and UAVs
  - new structures like bunkers, aerial arsenals and launch pads for intercontinental ballic missiles
  - new AI setup
  - new quotes
## Tipps:

  - You should have some fighters/anit-aircraft-weapons to patrol at your critical infrastructure for preventing bombers destroying it.
  - Some factions have 6th generation fighters. These in combat group with drones are able to attack targets behind the enemies' lines, although the enemy has maybe taken strong anti-aircraft measures (usefull if there's a sea between you and the enemy).
  - A few factions have access to launch pads for intercontinental ballistic missiles. You can activate or deactivate them. If you or one of your allies attack an enemy, you should deactivate the launch pads; else, there's the risk of friendly fire.
  - There are SSBNs, "ships submersible ballistic nuclear", that can launch SLBM-rockets, equipped with nuclear warheads, so, even if your homeland is wiped out, you can heavily damage your enemies' infrastructure and help your allies conquering them
  - Allways combine Tanks with self-propelled surface-to-air-missle systems, due to their vulnerability from the air.
